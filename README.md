# Cookbook App

Problem: It is difficult to keep a collection of recipes from across the internet. Current user “workarounds” involve using bookmarks, storing links, or just remembering where they found them. Furthermore, users have no way to keep track of edits to a recipe (e.g., add less salt, add more cayenne). Finally the experience of most recipe sites is terrible - filled with unnecessary text, bad design, and riddled with ads

Solution: Cookbook solves the above problem by storing user recipes on a webpage. When a user submits a url - cookbook processes the page and pulls out: time to prepare, servings, ingredients, and recipe. Users can then filter recipes by time, servings, and ingredients (future release). Ideally cookbook will not require accounts and can keep track of user info via cookies
