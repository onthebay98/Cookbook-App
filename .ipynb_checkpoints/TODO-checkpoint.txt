get recipe from soup; save as list of steps?

pull nutrition facts, directions

build in robust error checks; try/except catches

add a central database that collects recipe objects?

FIX: allRecipesTimeAndServingsParser()
- I can't use list indexing to do this - not all recipes have all 4 attributes
- find a new way to parse this
